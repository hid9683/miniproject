    bodyText: "January 2018 was the fifth warmest January in 138 years of modern record-keeping, according to a monthly analysis of global temperatures by scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. It was cooled somewhat by the current La Niña phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Last month was +0.78°C warmer than the average January of the 1951-1980 period. The only months of January warmer than that occurred in 2016 (+1.16°C), 2017 (+0.97°C), 2007 (+0.95°C), and in 2015 (+0.81°C). The East Coast of North America was cooler than normal — 1-2°C below the 1951-1980 mean — whereas the rest of the continent was about 5°C warmer than that period.",

    bodyText: "NASA’s own data reveal that world-wide ocean levels have been falling for nearly two years, dropping from a variation of roughly 87.5mm to below 85mm. These data, of course, clearly contradict the false narrative of rapid, never-ending rising ocean levels that flood continents and drown cities — a key element of the climate change “boogeyman” fiction that’s used to scare gullible youth into making Al Gore rich.",
